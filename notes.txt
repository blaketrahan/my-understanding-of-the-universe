my understanding of the universe

small discrete flicks of the ball, no variation
very realistic in that you only experience a few rules
    and those rules check out
    but gravity doesnt, but you arent exposed to that rule


games on top of a model of the universe


hopscotch and war (really be careful with this approach)



Each piece, or part, of the whole of nature is always merely an approximation to the complete truth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is only some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the laws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more likely, to be corrected.
